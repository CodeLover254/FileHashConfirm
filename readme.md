# FileHashConfirm
FileHashConfirm is a simple desktop application that compares a calculated file hash against a provided one. These checksums are used as a measure of file integrity.

This tool makes it very simple by just requiring you to drag and drop the file then paste the hash provided by your file vendor ( where you downloaded it from).

## Installation
This program does not require any installation. It is fully portable and can run even from a thumb drive.

## Supported Operating Systems
For the mean time only Windows has a ready to run executable. Please note that you need at least .NET Framework 4.5.2 for the program to run on you Windows PC.

For Mac and Linux, you can clone the project and build the Java source into an executable jar binary. I welcome anyone willing to produce these builds as a contributor to the project. JavaFX is required for the project to work.

## Coming Features
Validating checksums right from the context menu.
